      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm all about the user experience and making things better for people, and I actually think that's what drove me to study Mechanical Engineering. I've wanted to
        explore software and naturally found web development. This area has seen huge opportunities for job openings globally, and I wanted to pursue a career
        that would allow me to move around the US/world.</p>
